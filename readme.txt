== FEDORA 42 KDE PLASMA EDITION -- POST-INSTALL CUSTOM SETUP ==


This is a post-install custom setup script written specifically for Fedora 42 KDE Plasma Edition.


I wrote this script to take some of the hassle off of me when personalising Fedora after installing it.

The script will move all necessary included files in this repository to their correct locations on the file system, as well as pull and execute the install script for the Catppuccin KDE Plasma Global Theme using Git.
It will also enable RPM Fusion (including any multimedia codecs) and install a list of apps via RPM and Flatpak.

Apps installed via Flatpak:
    - Floorp
    - Vesktop
    - Lutris
    - Spotify
    - Prism Launcher
    - Flatseal

Apps installed via RPM:
    - OpenRGB
    - VLC Media Player
    - Steam
    - GIMP
    - Timeshift
